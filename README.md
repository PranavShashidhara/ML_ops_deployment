MLOPS Project

## Overview


In this project, I built a machine learning model using the Titanic dataset, with a primary focus on **MLOps practices**.  
The work includes:  
- Setting up **CI/CD pipelines** for automated testing and deployment  
- **Containerizing the model** using Docker  
- Exploring deployment via an **ONNX server** for optimized inference  

This project emphasizes the end-to-end workflow of taking a model from development to production in a reproducible and scalable way.
